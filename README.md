# Scenic Routes

## What is it?

You are new to a city. You want to go from A to B. However, the route between those two points is always the same: the shortest one. Taking the same route everyday is boring; I wanted new routes that make me see interesting stuff. Scenic Routes is a web application written in JavaScript that provides just that.

## Tech stack

Back-end:
- [Koa](https://koajs.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org/)
- [OPTICS (density clustering)](https://github.com/uhho/density-clustering)

APIs:
- [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

## Screenshots and details

In the first view, you start with a heatmap of Barcelona representing the locations of the 10,000 most interesting Flickr pictures taken in that area.

Zoom in, and the photos are clustered into interesting points. The more pictures have been taken at a point, the more interesting it is.

In the second view, you can get routed through those points. The routing algorithm enforces some rules:
- The more interesting a point is, the more likely you will get routed through it.
- The longer the route, the wider the search radius is and the more interesting points you will be routed through.
- Detours are allowed, but the commute is still kept to a reasonable amount of time.

## Getting started

### Prerequisite

You will need the [Scenic Routes backend](https://github.com/leonhfr/scenic-routes) if you want any sort of useful interaction with the application.

### Installation

Clone the repository, change to the directory of the client, install dependencies and run the React application:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/leonhfr/scenic-routes-client.git
cd scenic-routes-client
npm install
npm start
```

You might consider to change the Mapbox token in `/containers/Map.js` to your own.
